## Progress

### 2020.05.02_1850 

Initial Commit.  I have created the github repository for the project, and then cloned it to my local repo.  I then imported front-end starting point provided.  I then added the following directories__'models', 'routes'.  I then added the following '.js' files__'server', 'routes_api', 'routes_html', 'schema_workout', and 'model_workout'.  I then ran 'npm install' in 'develop' directory and created 'package-lock.json'.   Finally, I added initial comments to each '.js' file to plan out sections of code.

Completed initial setup of 'server.js' file, and began setting up Schema in 'schema_workout.js' file.  I then corrected initial progress timestamp in 'readme.md' file.

For 'routes_api.js' file, I completed CRUD functions.  I then began testing server locally and making adjustments when I encountered issues.  I then finished testing locally, and attempted to access mlabs again.  I was still unable to access mlabs or get an email response from mlabs.  Other than that, I believe the homework is complete.

For 'workout.js' file, I attempted to fix the duration function, and then commented it out after no solution was found yet.
