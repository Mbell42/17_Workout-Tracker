## Progress

Initial Commit.  I have created the github repository for the project, and then cloned it to my local repo.  I then imported front-end starting point provided.  I then added the following directories__'models', 'routes'.  I then added the following '.js' files__'server', 'routes_api', 'routes_html', 'schema_workout', and 'model_workout'.  I then ran 'npm install' in 'develop' directory and created 'package-lock.json'.   Finally, I added initial comments to each '.js' file to plan out sections of code.
